      "messageForIncorrectAnswer": "Incorrect. In the third conditional, 'would have' + past participle is used to express a hypothetical past result.",
      "explanation": "This is an example of an inverted third conditional sentence. 'Had I known' replaces 'If I had known,' and 'would have taken' is used in the main clause.",

      "messageForCorrectAnswer": "Correct! 'Was he' correctly follows the inversion rule after 'Not only' in formal contexts.",
